In a little over a month I'll be buying my first iPhone. I've wanted one since they were first released and by the time I felt I could afford it I was living in a city with no 3G coverage from AT&T. So I opted for an Android-based phone through Verizon. Naturally this meant that AT&T rolled out 3G support in my home town less than two months later.

There are things I like and dislike about my HTC Incredible. By and large it has been a good phone. Its camera is surprisingly good, and I've had excellent network covereage everywhere I've gone in the United States. It doesn't work in Europe except as a WiFi device.

One of the benefits of being a nerd is getting to do nerdy things. When I ordered the Incredible there was a three-week wait for delivery. So I bought the Pragmatic Press "Hello, Android" book and taught myself how to create Android applications. The benefit was getting to play with the Android simulator. In effect I got to learn the basic ins and outs of my phone before I had it in my possession. I am repeating this tactic with iOS by following the Stanford Univeristy iPhone Development course (CS193P). Of course I've had a work-assigned iPad for a year, and my wife has an iPhone 3GS I occassionally use. 

Over the summer I rooted my Android and I recently changed from the Cyanogenmod ROM to the MUIU ROM. One of the themes available for MUIU is a pretty good iPhone knock off. Also, unlike many Andorid ROMs, MUIU doesn't have an application drawer to hide applications. Every application on the phone is on a home screen somewhere. 

Having all my applications present all the time forced me to start using folders, and to consider the arrangement of icons. Over the past several weeks I have gradually gotten the apps that I use on the initial home screen, and less frequently used apps on the first screen to the right. The rest are in folders. I also set up a search screen as the first screen to the left of the primary screen.

Haptic feedback is one feature I have used a lot on my Android. Having the phone buzz and vibrate slightly with each input was nice initially as a way of positive feedback. Knowing that I'll lose this on the iPhone I've turned it off. Having phone that is utterly silent is different. 

Right after I bought my HTC I used the voice-assisted turn-by-turn navigation several times. Sibylle and I were looking to buy a house and it was fun to use the navigation to lead us across town from address to address. I rarely use the voice assist any more, but I do use the map feature from time to time.
