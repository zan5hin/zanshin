At the end of November I had foot surgery to remove bone spurs caused by arthritis from the first knuckle of my right big toe. Officially called a [cheilectomy](http://orthopedics.about.com/od/surgicalprocedur2/g/cheilectomy.htm "Cheilectomy") the surgery was one of three options available to treat my increasingly painful condition.

##A Brief History
For about ten years I have had pain in my right big toe. At first it was intermittent and not terribly painful. Over the past three or four years the pain has become constant and has increased in intensity. I never had a day when my toe didn't hurt, and I frequently had days when the pain was severe -- to the point where I wanted to hit my toe with a hammer as that would have hurt less.

As an adult I developed fallen arches and I believed that they were in part responsible for the pain in my toe. But even with good arch supports in all my footwear I still had constant pain. Any physical activity only made the pain worse. Mowing the lawn, bicycling, even swimming resulted in hours of increased pain.

##An X-ray
Earlier this fall I finally made an appointment with the orthopedic surgeon to see if there was anything that could be done for my toe. His x-rays revealed several bone spurs in the base joint of the toe, a condition called [hallux rigidus](http://orthopedics.about.com/od/toeproblems/qt/arthritis.htm "Hallux rigidius"). One of the bone spurs had actually broken off and was free floating in the joint. 

The doctor presented me with three options. One, I could do nothing. Continue to use over-the-counter or prescription medications to treat the pain and inflammation in my toe. Two, I could have the joint fused. This process would entail removing the cartilage and adding a small plate to the joint to hold the toe up at a slight angle to facilitate walking without (much of) a limp. Or, three, have a cheilectomy where the bone spurs are removed along with any bone necessary to return the joint to a normal range of motion. Since my toe still has a good amount of cartilage, the recommendation was the third option and not the fusion. 

##Surgery
I have no memory of the surgery. Thanks the the twilight anesthetic, which has a powerful amnesia effect, I have no memory of anything between getting the IV started and getting in the car to go home several hours later. Sibylle talked to the surgeon following the operation and he said everything went very well. They were able to remove all the bone spurs. Furthermore, they were able to flex the joint to 90ยบ meaning there is no mechanical reason I should have a vastly improved range of motion.

##Recovery
Most of the first few days of recovery were spent mildly dazed from the narcotic painkiller. I'd either lay in bed with my foot elevated, or sit in a recliner with my foot resting on enough pillows to raise it to the level of my heart. My foot was bandaged and then wrapped in gauze and finally wrapped in an Ace bandage. The gauze layer was the most problematic. When the gauze was wrapped around my foot it was woven between each of my toes. The cord between my big toe and the second toe was tight all the time and painfully tight any time I had my foot down for more than a few minutes.

I had a post op shoe that I wore 24 hours a day to protect my toe. This shoe has a rigid (or nearly rigid) sole, adjustable uppers and an adjustable strap at the ankle. The shoe allowed me to walk (limp) from chair to bed to bathroom. At night it helped to keep my from banging my foot. 

The wrapping around my foot stayed in place for two weeks. In order to shower my wife bought a plastic bag with a rubber grommet designed to protect casts that I wore over my post op shoe. We have a shower stool that I made extensive use of while bathing. Even sitting down I was only able to stand the increased pressure in my foot for 5 minutes or so. Most of my showers were short and to the point.

Toward the end of the second week I was able to cut back on the pain medication. Throughout the first two weeks I iced my calf, foot, and toe. I grew sick of the constant cold, but knew that the icing was helping to reduce swelling and thereby reduced my discomfort.

After the first week I would join Sibylle for short car errands around town. Sitting in the passenger seat I was able to prop my foot up on the corner of the dash by the door, which kept the swelling down. It was good to be out and about, if only in the car.

##Follow Up
At the two week mark my stitches were removed and I got to see my toe for the first time since the surgery. The line of the incision was nearly invisible, but the marks left behind by the four stitches were quite pronounced. The CNA covered the four sets of stitch holes with butterfly bandages and wrapped my foot in a new Ace bandage. They wanted the butterfly bandages kept dry for 24 hours but after that I could get them wet in the shower. Once a week had passed they could be removed.
