As Sibylle and I have upgraded computers we always keep the second most recent machine on hand as our "Money" computer. Nearly five years ago I showed Sibylle how to use the free trial version of Microsoft Money that was installed on her computer, and she has happily kept a close eye on our finances ever since. When we bought her first laptop, Money stayed on the desktop computer and it became known as "the money computer". Microsoft abandoned Money a year or so ago, so now we are using Intuit's Quicken to track our expenses and income, but we still refer to the machine as the "money computer". 

The current money computer is a Compaq CQ50 running Vista Home Premium. We bought it three years ago just prior to a trip to Europe, and it has been an excellent computer ever since. Three years of daily use, first as her primary computer, and for the last several months as the money computer, have taken their toll, however. The machine has been running slower and slower, and lately has been acting flaky.

The hard drive had slowly filled up to the point where there was less then 10 percent free space left - never a good situation for Windows operating systems. I managed to move old music and pictures to our network drive, which freed up some space, but the machines performance continued to be erratic at best. In the last few weeks it has taken to not refreshing the currently active program on the monitor. Obviously it was time for drastic measures.

Yesterday morning I set out to restore the machine to its fresh-from-the-factor-state. A quick Google search revealed that I could access the restore partition and reset the computer without the restore DVDs we made three years ago. An excellent discovery as we have moved twice `since those disks were made and I have no idea where they are today. The restore partition can be accessed by pressing `F11` during the boot sequence. Of course restoring the machine is the same as formatting the drive and reinstalling the operating system, so a full back up prior to starting is advisable.

I have a 500 GB external drive that works with either FireWire or USB that serves as my Mac OS TimeMachine. Using my MacBook Pro I formatted the drive as MS-DOS and plugged it into the Compaq. Not wanting to lose any long file names I used Windows to re-format the drive using NTFS. This took hours. I'm not sure if the delay was the state of the Compaq or the speed of the USB connection, or some combination of both. Once the drive was formatted I copied everything under Sibylle's account to the external drive. Another operation that took hours to complete.

By about 10 pm last night I finally was ready to reboot, poke F11, and start the restore. The restore process moved right along, and after several automated reboots the computer was ready for me to create an account. At 11:30 pm I had a working computer, in much the same state as it had been three years ago when we first unboxed it.

This morning I brought the computer with me to work so I could remove the factor installed software we don't want on the machine, add AVG Free Anti-Virus protection, update Windows, install Quicken, and generally customize the machine to our liking. I figure all of these processes will take quite a bit of time, and it's easy enough to let the machine crunch away while I work, with occasional interaction from me to click the inevitable `next` or `okay` dialog.

Updating Windows took a significant chunk of the morning. With three years of
updates to apply (121 updates) the process took a little over two and a half
hours to complete. The anti-virus scan took about an hour.
