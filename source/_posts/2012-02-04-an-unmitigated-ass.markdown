[Rick Santorum is an unmitigated ass](http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/02/03/418688/santorum-gay-marriage-privilege/ "Gays don't deserve privilege of marriage since they don't benefit society") &rarr;  
By his explanation, my childless marriage shouldn't earn the privilege of marriage either, since my wife and I aren't benefiting society by producing children.
