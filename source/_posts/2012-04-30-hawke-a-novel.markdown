After reading [Tsar](http://zanshin.net/2012/04/25/tsar/ "Tsar") and discovering Ted Bell's action series, I decided to go back and read all of the Alex Hawke books in order. This was obviously a first book, at least compared to _Tsar_. The characterizations were a bit overdone in places but on the whole it was a good read.
