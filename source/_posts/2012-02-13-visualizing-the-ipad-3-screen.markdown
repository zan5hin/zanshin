[Visualizing the iPad 3 Screen](http://david-smith.org/blog/2012/02/10/visualizing-the-ipad-3-screen/ "Visualizing the iPad 3 Screen") &rarr;  
Rumors about unreleased Apple products are just that, rumors. Still this visualization shows just how huge, in terms of pixels, a Retina Display iPad would be. Specifically it'd be 41% larger than the 1440x900 pixel display on my 15" MacBook Pro. In a word, hubba.
